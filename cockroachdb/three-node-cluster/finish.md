## Summary

There are different ways of deploying CockroachDB on self-hosted instances such as VMs, Kubernetes containers, secure (SSL) or insecure modes. All are aimed to be installed as a straight forward approach and make it easy to maintain. If you are looking for an approach where you don't need to maintain the cluster, Cockroach Labs offers [Cockroach Cloud](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/) as a Dedicated service or Serverless.

* We learned to deploy CockroachDB 3 node cluster
* We ran a workload that simulates transactions
* We monitored the cluster activity while a node was down and then restored
* We saw the value of using the distributed database and how it helps mitigate downtimes on critical workloads
